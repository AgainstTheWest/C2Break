# C2Break
A database management software exploit repository

# Explaination
This exploit is possible due to a SCA (Supply Chain Attack) setup by BrazenEagle. The result of this has been over the course of a couple days, however, it's not been mentioned anywhere other than by us on our Twitter page. The exploit is very easy to do and a PoC will arise very soon detailing about it. We've contacted BE about it and their connection to unethical hacking, which they've said "they don't care for".

It will be patched very soon (I expect!) as it's a dire situation. 
The exploit works by completely bypassing OAuth2, LDAP, JSON Web Token & Keycloak. No need for a pesky login prompt, when attackers can completely bypass it with this vulnerability.

# PoC
A video will be made on this soon :)
